Principles of Software Pathology

Pathos is Greek for suffering. 
And in medicine, pathology is the study of the causes and effects of disease or injury. 

As a Software developer I learn the arts of clean code including KISS, DRY and SOLID.
While learning my favorite was the Zen of Python, succint and beautiful.
And as I moved to AWS I learned the 5 pillar of a well-architected framework.

But today, I'm no longer a developer. 
My job is not to develop new features, nor mantain a system.
I'm a Software the kind of guy you call when things are not working anymore.
Maybe new development has stalled, or bugs are appearing more often.
Regardless, there is always a deeper cause and is my job to find which.

As I make the transition from Software Developer to Consultant
I face the following problem: how to objectively evaluate a code base in a short time.

Even as a neophyte, I have encountered wide variety of projects
from the ones very well-engineered, sophisticated and even difficult to understand.
To others absolutely rudemntary, even more difficult to understand.

As a consultant, the ideal experience I would like to offer my customers
is similar to a doctor's appointment, the customer reaches out to me
followig a set of questions, and perhaps some analysis
I'm able to determine the problem and suggest a treatment.

My niche is pre-seed startups where usually their main goal 
is to reduce the go-to market time and accelerate new features development.
Others, already have an MVP built and shown signs of product market fit and 
their goal is to bolster their platform to prepare to scale.

I specialize in AWS, DevOps.
