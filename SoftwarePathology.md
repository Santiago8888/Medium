Principles of Software Pathology

As I make the transition from Software Developer to Consultant
I face the following problem: how to objectively evaluate a code base in a short time.

Even as a neophyte, I have encountered wide variety of projects
from the ones very well-engineered, sophisticated and even difficult to understand.
To others absolutely rudemntary, even more difficult to understand.

As a consultant, the ideal experience I would like to offer my customers
is similar to a doctor's appointment, the customer reaches out to me
followig a set of questions, and perhaps some analysis
I'm able to determine the problem and suggest a treatment.

My niche is pre-seed startups where usually their main goal 
is to reduce the go-to market time and accelerate new features development.
Others, already have an MVP built and shown signs of product market fit and 
their goal is to bolster their platform to prepare to scale.

I specialize in AWS, DevOps.
