#### 3.1 The human body is the epitome of a well engineered system.
Futile is to attempt to describe the level of sophistication of the human body. But here are two example to give you an idea about it:

1) Each cell holds about 750MB of data in its DNA, about the same as a legacy CD.
We have about 1 trillion cells in our body, or close to a XXbyte of data.
That means that a single human stores the same amount of data as we collectively created as a society up to 20XX. Impressive!

2) Our brain has 100 billion neurons, that's about the same number of stars in our galaxy. Each neuron has on average 1,000 connections with other neurons. As a civilization, humankind has yet to reach 8 billion people, and on average the 2+ billion Facebook users have 300 "friends". Arguably, our the brain is a network more complex that our society as a whole by a factor of at least 25x.

That is why as a Software Engineer, I approach the study and appreciation of the human body with humbleness. My understanding is that every problem worth solving has already been solved by nature as first shared in The Viral Startup.


#### 3.2 Cells are the basis of human health.

A symptomatic disease in the human body is the result of many individual cells. In retrospect, this is obvious but when I first learned the concept it was not. 

In Software this can be applied to understand that technical debt is the result of many poorly desigend individual functions acting together.

Adopting the function as a minimal unit of Software Health analysis enables us to define concepts as "homeostasis" or "steady state" to empircally determine the characteristics of how a healthy function looks and consequently the health of a Software System. Some hints as to how this would look include:




#### 3.3 Cells die due to injury, failure to adapt or age.


#### 3.4 Inflamation is the mechanism for cells to heal.


#### 3.5 Blood (or its lack of) is the biggest source of cell disease.


#### 3.6 A surprinsingly big number of diseases are attributed to genes.


#### 3.7 We have an inmune system to heal ourselves.


#### 3.8 Histology is the study of tissues or how cell are connected.



### 4. Case Study: Diagnose the health of a React Application
#### 4.1 Measure the health of React Components.


#### 4.2 Map the flow of data through components.


#### 4.3 Review the short term history of Git commits.


#### 4.4 Classify the encountered pathologies.


#### 4.5 Recommend a treatment.

### 5. Next Steps: Turning Software Pathology into a Science


### 6. Conclusion


### 7. Bibliography
