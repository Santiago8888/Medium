# The Economics and Engineering behind Newsletters

**Abstract:** Competition in the digital space has increased as a result of the monopilazation of internet traffic and consumer's attention by tech giants. Newsletters present an opportunity for small and mid-sized businesses to nourish customer's loyalty and and develop new leads by recurrently delivering personalized information to the user's inbox.


### 1. Introduction

In Traction, Duck Duck Go's founder expains that there are [19 different acquisition channels](https://zapier.com/blog/acquire-customers/) that startups should try as part of their go-to market strategy. He acknowledges that not every acquisition channel works for every business and that the right channel may vary depending on the growth stage of the startup. Ultimately, the right acquisition channel is the one gets a startup closer to the goals required to secure the next funding round.

In 2008 Apple launched the AppStore serving as the ideal platform to fuel the rise of startups like Uber (2009) & AirBnB (2007) that leveraged an uncompetitive landscape to acquire the critical mass required to fulfill both sides of their marketplaces. Later, as apps floded the AppStore and Javascript frameworks like Angular (2010) and React (2013) popularized Single Page Applications many of the upside of mobile apps was lost. Then, startups turned to web applications to begin a new generation of B2B solutions leveraging agile and continous delivery practices.

Today, as SaaS dominate the IPO and startup ecosystem a new customer acquisition channel is gaining traction. Favoured by their low churn rates, their ideal fit to deliver sales funnels and personalization opportunities, newsletters are poised to disrupt user interfaces, how we consume information and create a new wave of startups selling intelligence leveraging recent advances in AI and recommendation systems.


### 2. Background

Early last year (2020), I launched my first side-project a job recomendation engine for software engineers. Then, I discovered an obvious truth: driving people to your website is hard. I experienced the same as a writer: Medium and SEO will get you some traffic but if you truly want a story to be succesful you gotta take distribution in your own hands.

As a result, I turned to Twitter and Social Media to [build an audience]() and own my distribution: It worked, I finally got steady traffic for my next project to get my first users and validate the idea. However, I stumbled upon the second hard truth: getting people to return to your website is also difficult. My product, a data dashboard was encountering a second problem: onboarding was complicated. Even if the product solved a legitimate problem, new users felt overwhelmed by the amount of information. And the beautiful, minimalistic user interface we crafted was not enough to compensate the overload of information.

The Morning Brew, was the first newsletter that I subscribed to, enjoyed, and became a regular reader. A couple years later, [its acquisition](https://www.axios.com/insider-inc-buys-majority-stake-morning-brew-e6ec0673-4354-4bc7-9feb-e0b149508c9a.html) grabbed headlines by valuing the newsletters and its 3 million subscribers at $75 million: newsletters had become a legit business. This was reinforced by the explosive growth of substack, it seemed that every tech influencer was launching their own newsletter. Ratification of newsletters popularity came after Mailchimp's [12 billion acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/intuits-12b-mailchimp-acquisition-is-about-expanding-its-small-business-focus/). 

Hesitant to jump into the bandwagon, I finally made the decision last month to transition my product into a newsletter. After the beta launch I'm impressed by the results: 
* Quick development cycles as a result of dumping Javascript.
* Instantanous load time facilitated by email apps' cache storage.
* Simplified data engineering by transitioning to batch proccesing.
* Optimal onboarding experience by delivering only the 20% of data that provides users the most value.
* Every email is a new opportunity to interact with users, thus reducing churn.

Going forward, I'm even more bullish about newsletters as they will quickly allow me to prototype new charts and features, drive product development with A/B testing and allow development efforts to focus in data science as opposed to engineering. As a former economist the following post examines the rise of newsletters from two different aspects: their economic benefits and engineering oportunties. 

My goal is for business owners to think of opportunities for smart newsletters to grow your business. Engineers and data scientists to appreciate the new challenges they present. And consumers to review your reading habits as newsletters gain relevance.
