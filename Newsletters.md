# The Economics and Engineering of Newsletters

**Abstract:** Competition in the digital space has increased as a result of the monopilization of internet traffic and consumer's attention by tech giants. Newsletters have presented an opportunity for small and mid-sized businesses to nourish customer's loyalty and develop new leads. This post explains why this is possible and how it can be taken one step further with AI and uber-personalization.


### 1. Introduction

In Traction, Duck Duck Go's founder expains that there are [19 different acquisition channels](https://zapier.com/blog/acquire-customers/) that startups should try as part of their go-to market strategy. He acknowledges that not every acquisition channel works for every business and that the right channel may vary depending on the growth stage of the startup. Ultimately, the right acquisition channel is the one gets them closer to next funding round. However, at each point of time there are certain acquisition channels that are inherently better for startups based on the basic laws of supply and demand. 

In 2008 Apple launched the AppStore serving as the ideal platform to fuel the rise of startups like Uber (2009) & AirBnB (2007) that leveraged an uncompetitive landscape to acquire the critical mass required to fulfill both sides of demand for their marketplaces. Later, as apps floded the AppStore and Javascript frameworks like Angular (2010) and React (2013) popularized the Single Page Applications desig, the momentum of mobile apps vaporized. Startups turned to web applications following agile methodologies and continous delivery to beget a new generation of B2B solutions like Snowflake and Databricks.

Today, as SaaS dominate the IPO market, a new customer acquisition channel is slowly gaining traction. Favoured by its low churn rates, its ideal fit for pursuing sales funnels and its personalization opportunities, newsletters are poised to disrupt what we think of a user interface. Following the rise of Substack, the sensational [12 billion Mailchimp's acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/intuits-12b-mailchimp-acquisition-is-about-expanding-its-small-business-focus/), and the [surprising success of the Morning Brew](https://www.axios.com/insider-inc-buys-majority-stake-morning-brew-e6ec0673-4354-4bc7-9feb-e0b149508c9a.html) in a cluttered industry we are shifiting where and how we consume information openning the door to a new wave of consumer or business oriented startups.


### 2. Motivation

Early last year (2020), I launched my first formal side-project: a job recomendation engine for software engineers. One month, before the pandemic the timing couldn't have more terrible. Despite that, I learned a valuable, yet obvious truth: driving people to your website is hard. I had experienced the same as a writer, while Medium and SEO would give some traffic to my stories, if I truly wanted to be succesful I needed to take distribution in your own hands.

As a result, I turned to Twitter and other Social Media platforms to *[build an audience](https://santiagoq.medium.com/dont-build-a-startup-grow-an-audience-89b810ec891c?sk=a940f4b0a9b65b063d8e55b272ec94ca)* and set up my own distribution channels: It worked! I finally got steady traffic for my next project. However, I stumbled upon the second hard truth: getting people to return to your website was also not easy. And my product, a data dashboard encountered a second problem: onboarding was painstakingly complicated. New users felt overwhelmed by the amount of information, and the beautiful, minimalistic user interface we crafted was not enough to compensate the overload of information.

As a first founder, I almost failed to the trap of thinking that I only needed one more feature to succeed. But after a six month break to pivot and explore other ideas, I realized the problem was not the idea, it was also not the product, the problem was *the medium*. If I could deliver the experience and data that 80% of my customers where asking and avoid them the need to visit my website I might have a chance of succeeding. It was settled, [SocialQ](https://santiagoq.gumroad.com/l/twitter-report) V2 was going to be a newsletter, and this post explains what I learned from building and launching it.
